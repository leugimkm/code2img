# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! CarbonPy is an open-source
project sustained mostly by volunteer effort.

There are lots of ways to contribute, such as (just to name a few):

- Suggesting a new feature
- Find/Fix bugs.
- Fix mistakes in the source code.
- Report parts of the documentation that you find confusing or unclear.
- Improve existing tutorials or write new ones.


## Submitting a pull request

If you've decided to fix a bug, even something as small as a single-letter
typo then great! Anything that improves the code/documentation for all
future users is welcomed.

When contributing try to stick to PEP8 guidelines of Python.
